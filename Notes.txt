Script Breakdown:
warning_prompt(): Displays a warning message to the user before launching the application and waits for the user to input yes to proceed. Any other input aborts the launch.
schedule_launch(): Asks the user how long they would like to wait (in seconds) before launching the application. It uses sleep to delay the execution.
start_django_server(): Verifies that the manage.py file exists and starts the Django development server.
This approach ensures that the user is aware of the launch and can schedule when to start the application.
